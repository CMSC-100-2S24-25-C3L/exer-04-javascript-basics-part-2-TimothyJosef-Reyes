What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
- JavaScript is quite the an extensive language as it has various NPMs or libraries that we can import and integrate into our code, saving time and effort while producing an efficient product. I also realized how important gitignore is because without it, the entirety of node_modules is commited and will be uploaded to the repository, I had to search how to delete commits to ensure that my repository will not look cluttered. This made me realize the importance of proper planning because I only had that problem because I didn't plan ahead.
